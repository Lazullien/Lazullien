Lazullien, currently a student, also working to be a game dev, i deposit some stuff here just cause why not
might as well help out people

how to use: simply click on all the repositories and star, go to twitter and follow, go to youtube and subscribe, it's that simple, don't overdo it though cause i have trouble with social interactions and am quite the loner
